#Description

You are responsible for getting everyone a mask at the meeting. If there's enough masks, return 0. If too much, return how much is leftover. Lastly, if not enough masks, return how much more is needed.

For example:
masks = 29
people = 20

Masks are left over, so return how much exactly is leftover, 9.

masks = 12
people = 30

Not enough masks, so return how much exactly is needed, 18.

masks = 15
people = 15

Enough masks, not too much, not not-enough, so return 0.



#Solution

def enough_masks(masks, people):
    return abs(masks - people)



#Test Cases

def cd():
    @test.it("Fixed tests")
    def __():
        test.assert_equals(enough_masks(10,10), 0)
        test.assert_equals(enough_masks(15,60), 45)
        test.assert_equals(enough_masks(1,3), 2)
        test.assert_equals(enough_masks(19,20), 1)
        test.assert_equals(enough_masks(13,13), 0)
        test.assert_equals(enough_masks(18,10), 8)
@test.it("Random tests")
def __():
    from random import randint
    for i in range(100):
        a = randint(1, 100)
        b = randint(1, 100)
        expected = abs(a - b)
        test.assert_equals(enough_masks(a, b), expected)
