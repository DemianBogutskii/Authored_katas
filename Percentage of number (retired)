    return round(number / 100 * percent)
    

#Description

Max needs to find the percentage of the given number for the upcoming test, but he doesn't know how to do it. HELP MAX!!!!

Write a function that gets two numbers (a number and percentage) and returns a percentage of the given number rounded to nearest integer.

Examples in sample tests.



#Tests

@test.describe("percentage_value")
def cd():
    @test.it("Fixed tests")
    def __():
        test.assert_equals(percentage_value(30,20), 6)
        test.assert_equals(percentage_value(36, 18), 6)
        test.assert_equals(percentage_value(100,32), 32)
        test.assert_equals(percentage_value(1,200), 2)
@test.it("Random tests")
def __():
    from random import randint
    for i in range(100):
        a = randint(1, 100)
        b = randint(1, 100)
        expected = round(a / 100 * b)
        test.assert_equals(percentage_value(a, b), expected)
